I didn't change too much. I ran the lighthouse report and fixed a couple little things for performance. For accessibility I changed the background to a shade of grey that apparently goes well with black for ease of viewing. The accessibility is still only 96. The best practices was 100 first time so I didn't bother. SEO is 75 because I admit that I didn't optimize for mobile very well. I'll fix it later if I have time. (The later me that procrastinated past 11 has determined that there wasn't enough time)
